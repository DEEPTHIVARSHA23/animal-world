                <h3>They're the world's largest land animal.<br><br>
                    You can tell the two species apart by their ears.<br><br>
                    Their trunks have mad skills.<br><br>
                    Their tusks are actually teeth.<br><br>
                    They've got thick skin. <br><br>
                    Elephants are constantly eating.<br><br>
                    They communicate through vibrations. <br><br>
                    A baby elephant can stand within 20 minutes of birth.<br><br>
