        <p><h3>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.<br> 
            Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally 
            symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, 
            arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, 
            containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates.<br> 
            Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian.<br> 
            Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago.<br>
             6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.<br>
            
            Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. <br>
            Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), 
            for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport.<br>
             Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports.<br>
              Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.<br>

            The natural world contains about 8.7 million species,

             according to a new estimate described by scientists as the most accurate ever.</p>
