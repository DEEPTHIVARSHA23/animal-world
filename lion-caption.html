                <h3>Lions are the only cats that live in groups.<br><br>
                Female lions are the main hunters.<br><br>
                Lions scent mark their territory, using their wee, to create a border.<br><br>
                A lion's roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.<br><br>
                Most lions are not afraid of campfires and will walk around them to see what's going on.<br><br>
